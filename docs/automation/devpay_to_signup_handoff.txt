  particular product.

          1. Activation Key, a short lived token associated with the
  customer's payment credential.
          2. The long form of the product name, a unique reference to the
  devpay product the customer has selected.

      -- Returns: 
          1. A secret access key
          2. The access key's ID, XXXwhy both this and the last?  I don't know yet.
          3. A user token, that is specific to the customer-product-payment credentials.
   
  (2) Verify the Access Key and ID:

  legitimacy criteria.  We only proceed further upon success.

          2. Secret Access Key
