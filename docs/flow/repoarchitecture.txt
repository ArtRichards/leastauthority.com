* "inclusion criteria":  Standards describing the properties of code included
  in a given repository  

A list of repositories:

  * "production":  This repository contains the currently running code:
  (e.g. leastauthority.com:/home/website)
  * "staging":     This repository contains tested code, awaiting review prior
  to inclusion in "production".  
  * "developing":  These repositories contain code under active
  development. (e.g. /home/zancas/source...)
  * "local":       These repositories are typically not visible to the
  community.  They frequently dwell on local machines, and have no inclusion criteria.


Inclusion Criteria By Repository:

  production:
    All unit and system tests pass.  Multi-developer review.

  staging:
    New Unit tests pass.

  developing:
    Old Unit tests pass. (I.E. no obvious regression.)

  local:
    None.


  
* Patches whose names begin with "NPR", are not production ready.  NPR patches
are to be re-recorded prior to inclusion in staging repositories
(/var/source...).

* My flow:

    (1) pull from staging to local repo
