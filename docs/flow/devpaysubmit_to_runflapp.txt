    Once AWS DevPay has successfully received an activation request it does
  two things:
   (1) It sends the user an "activation key". FOOTNOTE?--> The "activation key" is a
  one-hour-lifespan expiring token, that uniquely identifies a payment
  application.
   (2) It begins a "vetting" process to determine if the applicant's payment credentials are valid.

    Without reference to devpay's vetting process, the user's browser then
    informs the LAE-webserver by passing it the "activation key". The
    webserver sends a(n http?) request to the flappserver hosted signup
    service.

      This request has FOO BAR BAM SPAZM in its headers and SUCH AND FORTH IN ITS body.
