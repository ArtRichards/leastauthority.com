  The module 'leastauthority.com/lae_site/main.py' is the module python
  interprets to launch the lae_site webserver.  This module is invoked by start.sh.


Configuration:

  The Config class in lae_site/config.py sets up the current product line as
  a dictionary "products" attribute of the config instance.  The products are
  passed to the Config constructor from the '<leastauthority.com>/lae_site_config.json'
  
  The user selects from among the products with "listed":"true:  specified in
  lae_site_config.json.  When the site is configured each product is stored
  as a dictionary with a boolean value in its "listed" entry.

  XXXHandlers... question:  Under what circumstances will
  'os.path.dirname(__file__)' _NOT_ return the empty string?

  A SignupHandler is created at (XXXwhen?) the SignupHandler is passed a
  "products" object as specified (no doubt) in 

  JinjaHandler is a twisted.web.resource.Resource.  It is passed a
  template_name at instantiation.  

  (At least some, "render type"?!) Requests are handled by
  the JinjaHandler.  The handler first sets the request's response code to
  200 (received?).  The JinjaHandler then uses the jinja_render helper
  function to render and encode the JinjaHandler's template.

  So when a particular JinjaHandler receives a request it renders, encodes,
  (according to the specification in a jinja2 environment instantiated with a
  jinja2 FileSystemLoader with '../templates' as its instantiating argument).
  and returns the template.

  (Probably one JinjaHandler per template in lae_site/templates.)
