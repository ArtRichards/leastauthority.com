==========

LAFS-on-S3: the availability of Amazon S3 and the
*provider-independent security* of Tahoe-LAFS.

**What is LAFS-on-S3?**

  LAFS-on-S3 is a storage service offered by Least Authority
  Enterprises. It provides a reliable and scalable storage back-end
  for use with the Tahoe-LAFS client software.

**What is Tahoe-LAFS?**

  Tahoe-LAFS is a Free Software, Open Source "cloud storage" system
  that performs encryption, cryptographic integrity-checking, and
  erasure-coding on your files in order to give you
  *provider-independent security*. That means that the confidentiality
  and integrity of your files cannot be violated by the storage
  service provider. For more information see Tahoe-LAFS.org_.

  The open source Tahoe-LAFS project includes complete source code,
  including client and server. If you use the LAFS-on-S3 service then
  you need to run only the Tahoe-LAFS client softwareâ€”we provide the
  cloud. However, the LAFS-on-S3 service is completely open and
  transparent so that you have the option to migrate your data from
  LAFS-on-S3 to your own private Tahoe-LAFS cloud.

**Where is the data stored?**

  Your data, encrypted, is stored on Amazon's Simple Storage Service
  (S3), which is a convenient, reliable, and widely understood
  platform for storage.

**How much does LAFS-on-S3 cost?**

  $0.30 (USD) per gigabyte per month.

**What is the relationship between Least Authority Enterprises and the Tahoe-LAFS open source project?**

  Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, founder of Least Authority Enterprises, was
  one of the inventors of Tahoe-LAFS and continues to actively
  contribute to the project an architect and coder. Least Authority
  Enterprises intend to contribute all of our work to the open source
  project.
