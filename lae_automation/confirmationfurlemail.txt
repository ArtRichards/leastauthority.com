Welcome to the alpha programme!

In your Tahoe-LAFS gateway's tahoe.cfg, please use these settings:

[client]
introducer.furl =

shares.needed = 1
shares.happy = 1
shares.total = 1

[storage]
enabled = false

(The introducer furl is on one line.)

PS. I wasn't able to send you this encrypted because the key you submitted
was an ssh key. That shouldn't matter for the time being.
