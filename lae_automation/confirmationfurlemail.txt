Welcome to the alpha programme!  We assume you're either familar with the
basics of setting up, and interfacing with, a Tahoe-LAFS gateway, or willing
to learn.

If you do not already have the Tahoe-LAFS software on your trusted machine
you can obtain it here: 

  https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst

Once your gateway has been created please configure it as follows.

In your Tahoe-LAFS gateway's tahoe.cfg, please use these settings:

[client]
introducer.furl =

shares.needed = 1
shares.happy = 1
shares.total = 1

[storage]
enabled = false

(The introducer furl is on one line.)

PS. I wasn't able to send you this encrypted because the key you submitted
was an ssh key. That shouldn't matter for the time being.
