Welcome to the alpha programme! 

Please go to https://leastauthority.com/howtoconfigure for instructions
on how to set up and configure your gateway and start using the service.
The settings for your gateway's tahoe.cfg are:


[client]
introducer.furl = %(external_introducer_furl)s

shares.needed = 1
shares.happy = 1
shares.total = 1

[storage]
enabled = false


(The introducer.furl setting should be on one line.)

We hope you enjoy using our service and find it useful.
