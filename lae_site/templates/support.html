<h3>Product Support</h3>
<p>The quickest way to receive product support is via IRC.  The project developers
can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://freenode.net">irc.freenode.net</a>
in the channel #leastauthorityenterprises.
There, you can find support for product setup, sign up, and technical inquiries.
</p>

<p>For general product support questions, product inquiries, billing, or general questions,
please send a message to <a href="mailto:info@leastauthority.com">info@leastauthority.com</a>
with the subject "Product Support" and you will be contacted as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>To provide greater transparency into the reliability of our servers, our
monitoring system is open to public access by
following <a href="https://monitoring.leastauthority.com/zport/dmd/itinfrastructure">this
link</a>, and logging with username "guest" and password "guest". (this
currently gives a certificate warning, which will be fixed soon) Once logged
in you can view performance graphs for user EC2 servers by clicking on an IP
address, and then clicking the "Graphs" button in the left-hand menu.  We
also have
a <a href="https://leastauthority.com:8443/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/monitoring">public
mailing list for monitoring alerts</a>. In both of these, servers are
identified by their public IP address. New customers are informed of their
server's public IP address in the sign-up confirmation email, and existing
customers will be given this information shortly.
