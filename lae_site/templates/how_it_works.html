<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>The Python source code for this website, our automation and monitoring scripts,
and our fork of <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org">LAFS</a> to support Amazon S3
are all open-sourced under the
<a href="https://leastauthority.com/static/source/ticket999-S3-backend/README.txt">same
licenses as LAFS itself</a>. The S3 backend depends on a fork of the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/txaws">txaws</a> library that is open-sourced under
the MIT / X / Expat License.
</p>

<p>To obtain this source code, you currently need to install both
<a href="http://wiki.darcs.net/Binaries">darcs</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>
(we're part-way through a transition from darcs to git). Then use:</p>
<pre>
  darcs get --lazy https://leastauthority.com/static/source/ticket999-S3-backend
  darcs get --lazy https://leastauthority.com/static/source/monitors
  git clone https://github.com/LeastAuthority/leastauthority.com
</pre>
<p>The patches to txaws are at <a href="https://leastauthority.com/static/patches">https://leastauthority.com/static/patches</a>.
