<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>If you do not already have the Tahoe-LAFS software on your trusted machine
you can obtain it <a href=https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst>here</a>.</p>

<p>Or if you have a recent Debian- or Ubuntu-based Linux distribution and
prefer to use the version packaged with it, run:</p>

  sudo apt-get install tahoe-lafs

<p>(If using an OS package, replace 'bin/tahoe' with just 'tahoe' below.)</p>

<p>Once you've built or installed Tahoe-LAFS, run 'bin/tahoe --help' to check
that it is working. If you have any problems up to this point,
<a href=https://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev>the tahoe-dev mailing list</a> or the #tahoe-dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net are the best places to seek help.</p>

<p>To create a Tahoe-LAFS gateway on your trusted machine (in the default
location, which is the '<tt>.tahoe</tt>' subdirectory of your home directory), run:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe create-client
</pre>
<p>Then to configure the gateway for use with your LAE account, edit
<tt>YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.tahoe/tahoe.cfg</tt> to use the following settings (the
<tt>introducer.furl</tt> will have been sent to you in your sign-up confirmation
email):</p>

<pre>
[client]
introducer.furl = &ltspecific to each customer&gt
shares.needed = 1
shares.happy = 1
shares.total = 1
<br>
[storage]
enabled = false
</pre>

<p>Now start your gateway using:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe start
</pre>
<p>On Windows, you'll need to leave that command running; on other platforms
it will run in the background. Next, in your web browser go to:</p>
<pre>
  http://127.0.0.1:3456
</pre>
<p>to see the gateway's Welcome page. If everything is set up correctly, you
should see a green box starting with "Yes" in the list of connected servers.</p>

<p>We recommend that you begin by creating a directory and making the alias
'<tt>lae:</tt>' point to it:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe create-alias lae
</pre>
<p>then to see that directory in your browser:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe webopen lae:
</pre>
<p>You can use the 'tahoe backup' command to back up your files to this
directory, for example:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe backup DIRECTORY_TO_BACKUP lae:
</pre>
