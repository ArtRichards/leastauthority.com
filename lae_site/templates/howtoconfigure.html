<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>If you do not already have the Tahoe-LAFS software on your trusted machine
you can obtain it
<a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst">here</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you use the latest release, version 1.9.2.</p>

<p>Once you've built or installed Tahoe-LAFS, run '<tt>bin/tahoe --help</tt>' to check
that it is working. If you have any problems up to this point,
<a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev">the tahoe-dev mailing list</a>
or the <tt>#tahoe-lafs</tt> IRC channel on irc.freenode.net are the best places to seek help.</p>

<p>To create a Tahoe-LAFS gateway on your trusted machine (in the default
location, which is the '<tt>.tahoe</tt>' subdirectory of your home directory), run:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe create-client
</pre>
<p>Then to configure the gateway for use with your LAE account, edit
<tt>YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.tahoe/tahoe.cfg</tt> to use the following settings (the
<tt>introducer.furl</tt> will have been sent to you in your sign-up confirmation
e-mail):</p>

<pre>
[client]
introducer.furl = <i>specific to each customer</i>
shares.needed = 1
shares.happy = 1
shares.total = 1
</pre>

<p>(If you are repurposing an existing node to use as the gateway, also set <tt>enabled = false</tt> in
the <tt>[storage]</tt> section. It is already set that way when you create a node using
<tt>bin/tahoe create-client</tt>.)

<p>Now start your gateway using:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe start
</pre>
<p>On Windows, you'll need to leave that command running; on other platforms
it will run in the background. Next, in your web browser go to:</p>
<pre>
  http://127.0.0.1:3456
</pre>
<p>to see the gateway's Welcome page. If everything is set up correctly, you
should see a green box starting with "Yes" in the list of connected servers.</p>

<p>We recommend that you begin by creating a directory and making the alias
'<tt>lae:</tt>' point to it:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe create-alias lae
</pre>
<p>then to see that directory in your browser:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe webopen lae:
</pre>
<p>(The colon after <tt>lae</tt> is required here.)</p>
<p>You can use the '<tt>tahoe backup</tt>' command to back up your files to this
directory, for example:</p>
<pre>
  bin/tahoe backup DIRECTORY_TO_BACKUP lae:
</pre>
