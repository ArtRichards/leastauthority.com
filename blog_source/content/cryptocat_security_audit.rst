:summary: Least Authority performs security audit for CryptoCat

Our mission is to make verifiable end-to-end security available to everyone.

we did an audit of CryptoCat, funded by OTF

found several issues

They've all been fixed (or the feature temporarily disabled) by the CryptoCat developers.

The file transfer protocol could perhaps be replaced by a more standard or widely-implemented protocol, which the CryptoCat developers had already suggested on the otr-dev mailing list before our audit began. XXX ? Don't include too much detail?

We didn't have time to examine all parts of CryptoCat. Our final report of the security explains what parts of the program we looked at most closely (this is called the "coverage" results of the audit).

Props to CryptoCat for implementing end-to-end cryptography, making their work Free and Open Source, doing development in the open, inviting external review, and for focusing on usability and user-friendliness.

If you have any questions about these results or the process, the CryptoCat developers and we of LeastAuthority.com will be available on a reddit "Ask Me Anything" next blah blah blah to do Q&A about it.

The next audit we are doing is for GlobaLeaks, so stay tuned.
